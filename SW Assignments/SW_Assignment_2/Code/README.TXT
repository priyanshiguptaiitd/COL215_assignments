Use the the file "code.py" and ensure that the "input.txt" is located 
within the same folder as the "code.py" file (Code Directory).

The output file "output.txt" will be generated at the same place as the 
"code.py" file (Code Directory).

Note - That the test_single_case_mp function receuves the input file path and 
output file path from the "utils.py" file.
It has the following specifications at the time of submission : 

FP_SINGLE_CASE_IN = r"input.txt"

This Readme has instructions for testing the test cases

Use the the file "code.py" and ensure that the "input.txt" is located 
within the same folder as the "code.py" file (Code Directory).

The output file "output.txt" will be generated at the same place as the 
"code.py" file (Code Directory).

Note - That the "main.py" receives the input file path and 
output file path from the "utils.py" file.
It has the following specifications at the time of submission : 

FP_IN = r"SW Assignments\SW_Assignment_3\Files\Branch_Code_2\input.txt"
FP_OUT = r"SW Assignments\SW_Assignment_3\Files\Branch_Code_2\output.txt"
FP_REPORT = r"SW Assignments\SW_Assignment_3\Files\Branch_Code_2\report.txt"

Please change all these variables appropriately for correct implementation.

This directory will contatin all the files you would need for test case analysis 
(Including Graphs etc.)

1) TC_HI_STD_DEV - Ran on 250 Test Cases for 25,100,250,1000 gates with mean = 50 , Std Deviation = 25
   You will find the attached report and the average run time / packing efficiency at the end of directories (Test Cases attached)
   Graphing run time as well for a particular frequency of Test case (across all 250 cases)

2) TC_LO_STD_DEV - Ran on 250 Test Cases for 25,100,250,1000 gates with mean = 50 , Std Deviation = 10
   You will find the attached report and the average run time / packing efficiency at the end of directories (Test Cases attached)
   Graphing run time as well for a particular frequency of Test case (across all 250 cases)

3) TC_UNIFORM - Ran on 250 Test Cases for 25,100,250,1000 gates with uniform distribution in [1,100]
   You will find the attached report and the average run time / packing efficiency at the end of directories (Test Cases attached)
   Graphing run time as well for a particular frequency of Test case (across all 250 cases)

4) TC_INCREMENTAL  - Ran on number of gates in [25,1000], incrementing gate frequency by 25 every time
                     Graph of this is important ( Quadratic Fitting employed )

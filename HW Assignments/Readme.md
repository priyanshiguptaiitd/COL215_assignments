## Brief Descriptions of Assignments

### HW Assignment 1 - 2x1 and 4x1 MUX on Basys 3 Board

Implementing basic gates (AND/OR/NOT) using VHDL on FPGA board.
Combining gate instances to create a 2x1 MUX and then recursively 
to implement a 4x1 MUX

### HW Assignment 2 - 4 Digit Seven Segment Display

Design a combinational circuit that takes a single 4-bit hexadecimal or decimal digit
input from the switches and produces a 7-bit output for the seven-segment display
of Basys 3 FPGA board. Extend the design to create a circuit that drives all 4
displays for displaying 4 digits together.
